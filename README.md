## 🎌 About Me (自己紹介)

I'm a passionate developer, gamer, and anime enthusiast who lives at the intersection of code, creativity, and epic adventures! 🎮💻🌸 By day, I'm crafting digital solutions and exploring cutting-edge technologies. By night, you'll find me either grinding through challenging games, analyzing character development in anime series, or building my own gaming projects.

I believe programming is like storytelling - every function has a purpose, every bug is a plot twist, and every deployment is a satisfying level up! Gaming has taught me strategic thinking and perseverance, while anime inspires my creativity and problem-solving approach. My ultimate goal? To create software and games that deliver the same thrill and emotional impact as my favorite anime series and gaming experiences.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me analyzing character development in series like **Attack on Titan** or **Death Note**, drawing parallels between strategic problem-solving in programming, gaming, and anime battles. Every raid boss feels like debugging a complex algorithm, and every anime arc teaches me about narrative structure in code!

## ⚡ Fun Fact (豆知識)

I once stayed up for 48 hours debugging a complex algorithm while simultaneously grinding a challenging boss in **Dark Souls** and binge-watching **Attack on Titan** - the persistence from gaming and strategic thinking from anime actually helped me crack the code! I believe the best code is written with the same dedication as an anime protagonist pursues their dreams, and every bug hunt feels like an epic gaming raid.

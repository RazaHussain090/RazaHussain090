## 🚀 Full-Stack Developer | Game Dev | Creative Coder

I'm a passionate developer who bridges the worlds of code, gaming, anime, and digital art. By day, I craft robust web applications and explore emerging technologies. By night, I'm either debugging complex algorithms like a raid boss, composing game soundtracks, or designing characters inspired by anime aesthetics.

**My philosophy:** Every line of code tells a story, every bug is a plot twist, and every deployment is a satisfying crescendo. I draw inspiration from the strategic depth of *Attack on Titan*, the perseverance of *Dark Souls*, and the creativity of *One Piece*.

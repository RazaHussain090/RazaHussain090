## 🎌 About Me (自己紹介)

I'm a passionate developer who finds inspiration in both code and anime! 💻🌸 By day, I'm crafting digital solutions and exploring cutting-edge technologies. By night, I'm diving into epic anime stories that fuel my creativity. I believe programming is like storytelling - every function has a purpose, every bug is a plot twist, and every deployment is a satisfying arc resolution!

When I'm not coding, you'll find me analyzing character development in series like **Attack on Titan** or **Death Note**, drawing parallels between strategic problem-solving in both programming and anime battles. My ultimate goal? To create software that impacts lives as much as my favorite anime series have impacted mine.

## ⚡ Fun Fact (豆知識)

I once debugged a complex algorithm while watching a particularly intense episode of **Steins;Gate** - the time travel concepts in the anime actually helped me visualize the solution! Also, I believe the best code is written with the same dedication as an anime protagonist pursues their dreams.
